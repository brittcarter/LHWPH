		<h3 id="1">Laser-Like Lipo</h3>
		<p>The Laser-Like Lipo was designed to specially address spot fat reduction (or inch loss) and body contouring. Administered in relaxing 7-30 minute sessions, the Laser-Like Lipo provides inch loss, but without the surgery, the pain, or the extensive recovery time. By directly targeting adipose cells (or fat cells) the Laser-Like Lipo offers a safe and effective spot fat reduction solution that can be applied to multiple problem areas including: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Waistline</li>
			<li>Mid and Lower Abdomen</li>
			<li>Upper, Mid, and Lower Back</li>
			<li>Buttocks and Thigh Areas</li>
			<li>Arm and Underarm Areas</li>
		</ul>
		<p> The Laser-Like Lipo is a 100% Non_invasive, laser-based, spot fat reduction and body contouring system. Offering the relaxation of a 40-minute massage with the benefit of inch loss!<br><br>Rather than a painful incision, the Laser-Like Lipo uses laser energy to safely (and painlessly) penetrate the skin and target specific adipose (or fat) cells. It is through this targeted process that the Laser-Like Lipo is able to in fact stimulate the cell itself into releasing water, free fatty acids, and glycerol. Having released these three compounds, water, free fatty acids, and glycerol (often referred to as Triglycerides), the fat cells "shrink" significantly, resulting in inch loss for patients!

		<h3 id="2">Whole Body Vibration</h3>
		<p>The application of vibration for the improvement of human performance were developed in ancient Greece. As a therapy, the whole body vibration (sometimes abbreviated as WBV) was explored by Russian Scientists who tested vibration on astronauts in an effort to decrease the loss of muscle and bone mass in space.<br><br>Recently whole body vibration platform have been popularized and in home gyms as one of the hottest new trends in exercise. <br><br>The important difference between conventional training methods and WBV is that there is only a minimum of loading. No additional weights are necessary, which ensures that there is very little loading to the passive structures such as bones, ligaments and joints. That is why WBV is extremely suited to people that are difficult to train due to old age, disease, disorders, weight or injury. On the other hand, it is also very suitable for professional athletes who want to stimulate and strengthen their muscles without overloading joints and the rest of the physical system (Cochrane et al 2005 [26]; Mahieu et al 2006 [27]).<br><br>Whole body vibration training is an excellent adjunct to the Laser-Like Lipo treatments and can help accelerate the results of any treatment.

		<h3 id="3">Nutritional Counseling</h3>
		<p>There are so many different books, thoughts, opinions, studies, etc out there, about eating healthy. <br><br>We understand that everyone is different.<br><br> So what we do is help you find out what food is best for you. Not only for losing weight, but for being healthy as well.<br><br>You might ask yourself things like:<br><br>Should I be a <b>carnivore, omnivore, vegetarian</b> or perhaps even a <b>vegan</b> (no animal products what so ever)--no eggs, cheese, no cod liver oil. <br><br>Should I eat a <b>high carbohydrate-low fat diet </b>(govrn.’s food pyramid). Or should we eat a <b>high protein--low carbohydrate diet </b>(Atkins) or maybe the <b>Zone diet</b> (Barry Sears) suggesting that the way to go is by eating 40% carbs, 30% prot, 30% fat.<br><br>What about specific food products?<br>What is best--butter or margarine, is chocolate good now, I hear it has antioxidants?, what about eggs? (egg white, eggbeaters, or can we actually eat the whole thing). <br><br>We mainly fall in three different categories in terms of our metabolism.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Carb type</li>
			<li>Protein type</li>
			<li>Mixed type</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Let our healthcare providers help you discover what diet is best for your body.

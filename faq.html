		<h3 id="2">1. How does the Light work to shrink the fat cells?</h3>
		<p>Light energy emitted by the Slim Light safely penetrates the patient's skin. At specific frequencies, coherence and power settings, fat cells absorb the electromagnetic energy from the Light.<br><br>When enough energy is absorbed, transitory (short-lived) pores form on the surface of the fat cells. Water, glycerol and free fatty acids then leak out of the fat cells and through the body's natural cleansing system are released into circulation to be processed and removed naturally. This is just like what happens when you exercise.<br><br>As a result, the fat cells are smaller which results in inch loss, fat loss and often a reduction in the appearance of cellulite.</p>
		<h3 id="3">2. Don't people have to just diet and exercise to lose weight?</h3>
		<p>Losing weight for many is not just about diet and exercise. It is about caffeine, stress, poor sleep, pain, over eating, under eating, wrong kind of exercise, wrong kind of diet and other lifestyle factors. They can eat less and exercise more, and still not lose weight.<br><br>That is where The Slim Light comes in - helping people who have tried, but just cannot seem to produce results. The Slim Light helps them produce results with lifestyle changes.<br><br>People who do all the right things, and are mostly healthy and fit, but they still have that one problem area, no matter what they do, the Light can spot reduce.<br><br>People who want to be healthy, but lack the motivation because they don't really see any results when they are being healthy, this helps them see really quick results -and now they are more motivated to stick with those healthier lifestyle choices. </p>
		<h3 id="4">3. How long does it stay off?</h3>
		<p>Not matter what people do, drugs, surgery, pills, potions, or even diet and exercise, if they don't maintain their lifestyle, no weight will ever stay off. This is no different. To maintain weight loss, there is only one way - no matter what you do or don't do. Keep living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
		<h3 id="5">4. Is there a guarantee?</h3>
		<p>If you complete 9 sessions and you do not lose at least 1 inch or more on one measurement with minor lifestyle changes* or noticeable difference in the appearance of cellulite we will give you additional session until you get there.<br><i>Minor changes include - not eating for 1 hour before or 3 hours after a session, doing at least mild exercise the day of your sessions,drinking more water, using the included cream,and doing the included detox program.</i><br><br>If you complete the sessions and you do not lose at least 2 inches or more in one measurement area with lifestyle changes or a noticeable difference in the appearance of cellulite we will give you additional session until you get there.<br><i>Changes include all of the above, plus burning 500 calories every day you have a session, and eating less than 50 grams of sugars per day for 3 weeks.</i>
		</p>
		<h3 id="6">5. Is it safe? </h3>
		<p>Absolutely. Not a single known side effect to this day<br><br>Slim Light treatments are completely non-invasive and clients feel nothing but warmth. The devices low level Light technology has been studied and used for over 30 years for many biomedical purposes.
		</p>
		<h3 id="7">6. What do patients do to maintain the fat loss?</h3>
		<p>Normal things you need to keep weight off - diet and exercise, drinking water and the like. If people go back to overeating and a poor diet they will gain fat back. But unlike other treatments, clients do not need to as much to retain the fat loss benefits.
		</p>
		<h3 id="8">7. What kind of results are produced?</h3>
		<p>The average in my office is 11 inches in 42 days. We have a range of 7-23 inches in 18 visits.People who make minor lifestyle changes, are on the higher end of the average, and those who don't, the lower end.<br><br> Lhw Physique has statistical rates of 98.9% success in weight loss. Our clients have seen a 95% decrease in Diabetes, Hypertension, and Obesity. This method also decreases neuropathy and pain by 99%.</p>
		<h3 id="9">8. What is involved?</h3>
		<p>Initially, 3 sessions a week, for 3 weeks, 7-30 min per session. You relax in a comfortable position while a trained Slim Light technician places two - eight multi-Light paddles and two smaller Lights to the target areas. Then lay back, relax, read, or whatever you like. Then the vibrating platform for exercise and lymphatic drainage.<br><br>Most clients choose to take a further 9 sessions, making 18 in total, for best results.</p>
		<h3 id="10">9. Where does the fat go?</h3>
		<p>That fat gets burned as energy in the body, or normal metabolic processing-just like when you exercise and release fat.</p>
		<h3 id="11">10. How quickly will patients see results?</h3>
		<p>Many clients see measureable results after their first session. The number of sessions they want is the only limitation to how much a patient can lose.</p>
